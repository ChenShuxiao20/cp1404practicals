# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

80%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Generally, I watch lecture videos for about 2 hours at home on weekends

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I will continue to work hard to meet the requirements of homework, listen carefully in class, and follow in the footsteps of the professor.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

After that, I will try my best to watch the lecture before class, master the course knowledge in advance, and write it down when I encounter difficulties, and ask the professor for help offline. I believe this will be of great help to my study.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I am still not proficient enough in pseudocode, and I need to continue to strengthen it. And there are many knowledge points that are not clear enough. After that, you should practice frequently and master them firmly.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Overall, it's not bad. I can try my best to complete the requirements of my homework and master most of the knowledge of this subject, so I still need to study hard and do my best to master more knowledge.
